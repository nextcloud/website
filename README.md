# Start

Run `hugo` and then serve the folder `public` on a webserver.

This can be accomplished by running this command:

```
hugo server
```

and open [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) in the browser.

* `/css`
* `/static-assets`

This should be a showcase on how well it all works together during the step by step migration from Wordpress to Hugo. Once the state of the staging environment is ready for production we will move it over to the real website and monitor it.
